        <p>For 4+ years, Women in Computing has been hosting quarterly programming competitions, Beginner&apos;s Programming Competition, for 200+ undergraduate students who have not taken upper-division Computer Science or Data Science courses. The students solve 10 questions similar to those used in programming interviews in 3 hours. The competition format is similar to ACM ICPC, where participants brainstorm and pair-program to have fun and win prizes.</p>

              Empowerment and Development for Girls in Engineering (EDGE) is a mentorship program by WIC at UCSD and SWE at UCSD that aims to inspire and empower high school girls to consider STEM-related careers in order to bridge the gender gap in engineering fields.
              As an EDGE mentor, you will have the opportunity to get paired with a high school mentee and guide them through their journey in STEM.

            WIC Mentor-Mentee is a collaborative partnership between a mentor and mentee that supports mutual growth through the sharing of talents, skills, and experiences. It involves a meaningful investment of time and effort from both parties and serves as a valuable opportunity for personal and professional development.
            Being a part of this program will give you the opportunity to support your peers and help contribute to their undergraduate experience in computing, in addition to giving you a chance to develop a closer relationship with the WIC community here at UCSD!
            Mentors and mentees are paired every fall quarter. Be on the look-out for applications to open in the fall!

        <h1>Project Teams</h1>
        <p>
          WIC Project Teams is designed to give students an opportunity to gain project experience. Join or get placed into a team and build a project (website application) over the quarter that you can showcase to potential employers.
          Prior website/mobile development experience is not necessary. We are looking less at technical experience and more at motivation and initiative!
          Each quarter, projects will be centered around a theme. For example, in Winter 2025, the theme was creating a website centered around activism. 
          Keep an eye out for when applications open each quarter. In the meantime, check out some of the past projects below!
